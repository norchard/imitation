          I am a self-taught web developer and graphic designer. In undergrad I
          studied History and Studio Art, but I was most capivated by my single
          typography course. After graduating, I started studying using online
          resources to get myself up to speed with graphic design tools. I
          learned quickly and began working as a designer. During those years I
          continued to studyâ€”this time focusing on programming. In 2017 I did a
          batch at the{" "}
          <a target="blank" href="https://www.recurse.com/">
            Recurse Center
          </a>{" "}
          where I studied computer science fundamentals. In between design work
          I also worked as a Software Engineer at{" "}

          </a>
          . Now I'm re-focusing on front-end development because I have always
          been mesmerized by the magic of creating websites. Until I find
          full-time work doing front-end development, I'll be here honing my
          craft, recreating work I admire.
